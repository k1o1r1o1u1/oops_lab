/*
Suppose we have three classes Vehicle, FourWheeler, and Car. The
class Vehicle is the base class, the class FourWheeler is derived from it
and the class Car is derived from the class FourWheeler. Class Vehicle
has a method 'vehicle' that prints 'I am a vehicle', class FourWheeler has
a method 'fourWheeler' that prints 'I have four wheels', and class Car
has a method 'car' that prints 'I am a car'. So, as this is a multi-level
inheritance; we can have access to all the other classes methods from
the object of the class Car. We invoke all the methods from a Car object
and print the corresponding outputs of the methods. So, if we invoke the
methods in this order, car(), fourWheeler(), and vehicle(), then the
output will be,
- I am a car
- I have four wheels
- I am a vehicle
Write a C++ program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance using the
above.
